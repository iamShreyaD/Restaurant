                <h6>Indian Cuisine</h6>
                <p>Indian cuisine reflects an 8000-year history of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent, leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later trade with British and Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine.</p>
                <p>Cuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits and vegetables are ripe.</p>
                <p>The interaction of various Indian diaspora communities with the native cultures in their new homes has resulted in the creation of many fusion cuisines, which blend aspects of Indian and other international cuisines. These cuisines. These cuisines tend to interpolate Indian seasoning and cooking techniques into their own national dishes.</p>
                <p>Indian migration has spread teh culinary traditions of the subcontinent throughout the world. These cuisines have been adapted to local tastes, and have also affected local cuisines. The international appeal of curry has been compared to that of pizza. Indian tandoor dishes such as chicken tikka also enjoy widespread popularity.</p>
                <p>For Indians, food can bring back fond memories. The 'cutting chai' (term used for a small cup of tea) and 'pakodas' (breaded and batter-fried vegetables) are reminders of soft rainy days, or the 'chole bhatura's (spicy ckickpea curry with warm freshly made puris) a cold winter's day, or ice cold 'kulfi' (cremier and denser than ice cream, served in clay pots in flavors like mango, pista, and rose) a way to beat the heat. Indians love their small snack in the middle of long day's work or just to take a break between shopping or because it's hella tasty!</p>
